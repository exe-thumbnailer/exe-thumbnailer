The Debian Package gnome-exe-thumbnailer
----------------------------

This package was made based on an idea first seen in Ubuntu Brainstorm.  It was
then written as part of the Karmic-Wine-Integration spec for Ubuntu:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/karmic-wine-integration

It is my hope that this can be merged upstream and become a part of a default
Gnome desktop, as I feel it adds a lot of usability even when you don't have
Wine installed.
